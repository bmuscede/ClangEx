# ClangEx - *A Fast C/C++ Fact Extractor*

This readme contains information about ClangEx, as well as setup and usage details.

Table of contents coming soon.

## What is ClangEx?
ClangEx is a C/C++ fact extractor that uses Clang libraries to extract details from C or C++ source code to a lightweight but powerful program model. This program model can be visualized or queried using relational algebra to discover problems in source code on an ad-hoc basis.

The model generated by ClangEx is encoded in the Tuple-Attribute (TA)  format. This format was developed by Ric Holt at the University of Waterloo and is discussed in [this paper](http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~holt/papers/ta-intro.htm). The TA format contains entities, their relationships, and attributes that describe these entities and relationships. 

While ClangEx is developed to extract facts to a program model, users must download additional tools from the [Sofware Architecture Group (SWAG)](http://www.swag.uwaterloo.ca/) at the Univesity of Waterloo to visualize or query their programs. This guide wil cover how these tools are configured in the "setup" section.
