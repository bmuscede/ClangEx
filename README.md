# ClangEx - *A Fast C/C++ Fact Extractor*

This readme contains information about ClangEx, as well as setup and usage details.

## What is ClangEx?
ClangEx is a C/C++ fact extractor that uses Clang libraries to extract details from C or C++ source code to a lightweight but powerful program model. This program model can be visualized or queried using relational algebra to discover problems in source code on an ad-hoc basis.

The model generated by ClangEx is encoded in the Tuple-Attribute (TA)  format. This format was developed by Ric Holt at the University of Waterloo and is discussed in [this paper](http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~holt/papers/ta-intro.htm). The TA format contains entities, their relationships, and attributes that describe these entities and relationships. 

While ClangEx is developed to extract facts to a program model, users must download additional tools from the [Sofware Architecture Group (SWAG)](http://www.swag.uwaterloo.ca/) at the Univesity of Waterloo to visualize or query their programs. This guide wil cover how these tools are configured in the "setup" section.

###Features of ClangEx
Currently, ClangEx supports the following:

* Both C & C++ language support including `C++11` and `C++14`.

* A more detailed program model compared to other extractors due to access to Clang's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

* The ability to generate a model for selected source files. This means that not all source files in a program have to be generated at once. This is achieved through ClangEx's manual ID linking system.

* A fluid metamodel. Users can choose to exclude certain portions of ClangEx's metamodel to generate TA files that suit them. For instance, TA models can be generated that don't include variables or classes.

###ClangEx Metamodel

## Installation Details
###Prerequisties
ClangEx is based on `Clang 4.0.0` and requires `CMake 3.0.0` or greater to run. Additionally, to build ClangEx, `Boost` libraries are required. For `Boost`, the computer building ClangEx requires `Boost` version `1.5.8` or greater. If you meet any of these prerequisites, feel free to skip their associated section below.

####Installing CMake
First, CMake should be installed. On Linux, this is as simple as running:
```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
```
This will install the most current version of CMake based on your sources list. Be sure to check the version to ensure you have a version of CMake greater than `3.0.0`. This can be done by running:
```
$ cmake --version
```

---
If you want the most current version of CMake, this will require a bit of additional work. First, download the most recent version from the [CMake website](http://www.cmake.org) and download the Linux source version. The commands below show how CMake is installed from the `3.7.0` Linux source version. Change the version label in the download link to download a different version.

First, we download and unzip the source files:

```
$ wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.0.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf cmake-3.7.0.tar.gz
$ cd cmake-3.7.0.tar.gz
```

Next, install CMake by configuring the Makefile and running it. This can be done by doing the following:
```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```
That's it! You can check if CMake is correctly installed by running:
```
$ cmake --version
```

####Installing Clang
The best way to install Clang on your system is to download Clang directly and compile the source code directly. As stated, `Clang 4.0.0` or greater is required. This guide will cover how to install Clang from source.

First, Clang must be downloaded from the Clang and LLVM website. To do this, simply run the following:
```
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm
$ cd llvm/tools
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang
$ cd clang/tools
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra/trunk extra
$ cd ../../../..:
```

Next, we need to build LLVM and Clang. Sit back and make a coffee during this process as this can take up to **several hours** depending on your computer. The following steps will build Clang to a directory called `Clang-Build` adjacent to the Clang install directory. To change this, simply replace the `Clang-Build` directory with any other directory and location you choose. 

To build LLVM and Clang, run the following:
```
$ mkdir Clang-Build
$ cd Clang-Build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm
$ make
$ make install 
```

**(OPTIONAL)** If you want to try a faster compilation tool, replace `Unix Makefiles` in the command above with `Ninja`. You may need to install `Ninja` for this to work. Then, simply run:
```
$ ninja
$ ninja install
```

That's it! With this, Clang and LLVM will be installed. To ensure proper installation, run the following to check:
```
$ clang --version
```

####Obtaining Boost Libraries
Boost libraries are also required. This process is very simple on Debian/Ubuntu systems.

Simply run the following command to download and install Boost libraries to your system's `include` path:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
###Building ClangEx
Now that the prerequisties are all satisfied, you can now download and build ClangEx! If all prerequisties are truly satisfied, ClangEx should build without issue.

First, we must checkout the current version of ClangEx from GitHub. This will be downloaded to your current working directory. The ClangEx repository has all required files and libraries.

To download, run the following:
```
$ git checkout https://github.com/bmuscede/ClangEx.git
```

Next, we want to build the source code. This process may take several minutes due to the heavyweight size of the Clang libraries. This guide will build clang to the `ClangEx-Build` directory that is adjacent to the `ClangEx` library. If you want to build to a different directory, replace the following `ClangEx-Build`s  to the directory of your choice.

To build, run the following command:
```
$ mkdir Clang-Build
$ cd Clang-Build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ClangEx
$ make
```

To verify that ClangEx built, ensure the `ClangEx-Build` directory contains a `include` subdirectory and that the ClangEx executable exists. Additionally, run the following to check if it runs:
```
$ ./ClangEx --help
```
You should see a help message with all available commands.
###Installing Additional Anaylsis Tools
There are two specific tools that are required to perform analysis on TA program models generated by ClangEx. Both of these tools
